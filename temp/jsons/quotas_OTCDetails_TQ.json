        "OTC": "2.   Rice Quota Administration \n\nChinese Taipei shall ensure that rice from central stocks shall no longer be prohibited from entering domestic marketing channels for industrial and/or food use.  Imports of rice for re-export shall not count against imports under the tariff-rate quota.  Chinese Taipei shall lift its ban on imported rice upon accession and establish a tariff-rate quota (TRQ).  This TRQ shall be 144,720 metric tons calculated on a brown rice basis starting from the year 2003.  Future quota growth shall be consistent with commitments undertaken by WTO Members in connection with negotiations conducted pursuant to the outcome of negotiations under the Doha Development Agenda.\n\nCENTRALIZED IMPORTS\n\nSpecification of Imported Rice: Rice imported by the Chinese Taipei authorities shall be tendered to meet internationally recognized standards for trade in rice.\n\nDisposal of Imported Rice: Imported rice shall be accorded no less favourable treatment than rice produced in Chinese Taipei. Imported rice shall have full access to normal marketing channels, wholesalers, distributors, and end users. It shall be priced at a level which ensures that it enters the domestic market at prices competitive with rice produced in Chinese Taipei.  Imported rice shall be marketed in a timely fashion so that its quality for table use is not adversely affected by storage time. Imported rice shall not be exported as food aid, nor used for livestock feed.\n\nThere shall be permitted an aggregate quantity of rice for centralized imports, entered into subheadings HS 10061000, 10062000, 10063000, 10064000 during any calendar year, of not less than the total quantity specified below. \n\n                          Centralized Import Quantity\n                                   (metric ton)\n\nUnited States           64,634\nAustralia                  18,634\nThailand                     8,300\nEgypt                        2,500\n\nThe quantitative limitations established by this note shall be administered through regulations (including licenses and reallocation of unfilled quotas) issued by the Council of Agriculture.  Any change in the centralized import quantity and share shall be subject to negotiation between Chinese Taipei and other interested WTO Members. \n\nPRIVATE SECTOR TRADE\n\nDirect Private Sector Trade: Chinese Taipei’s TRQ system for private rice trade shall be conducted through direct private-sector importation. The system shall be operated with the objective of ensuring that the TRQ fills with a minimal level of market distortion and that the imported rice enters Chinese Taipei’s domestic wholesale and retail markets on conditions no less favourable than exist for rice produced in Chinese Taipei. Thirty-five percent of the TRQ quantity shall be reserved for private-sector imports unless agreement is reached between Chinese Taipei and other interested WTO Members regarding a change in the private sector share.   \n\nTerms of Trade: Quota allocation certificates shall serve as automatic import licenses, in compliance with the Agreement on Import Licensing Procedures and consistent with Article XIII of GATT 1994. All commercial terms of trade, including product specifications, origin, pricing, packaging, etc. shall be at the sole determination of the parties engaged in the transaction.  Partial shipments against a single allocation shall be permitted.  Traders may import any product or mixture of products subject to the same TRQ as noted in Chinese Taipei’s schedule.  Imported rice shall be permitted to be distributed freely within Chinese Taipei without further trade-based restrictions.  Allocation certificates shall be freely transferable and tradable, and certificate holders may have certificates reissued to combine or divide allocations.\n\nApplication:  All applications for allocation of TRQ quantities shall be submitted to the Ministry of Finance (MOF).  By 30 September of the previous year, the number of segments, the quantity of each segment, and the specific conditions for applying for a TRQ allocation shall be published in the official journal. MOF shall grant allocations and publish and notify the names of recipients and allocations within 14 calendar days of the close of the application period. The TRQ shall be allocated in accordance with the provisions of this headnote and paragraph 34 of the Working Party Report. Any trader registered as a food dealer can apply for a TRQ allocation.\n\nAssociated Fees: Any and all fees, charges, deposits, duties, etc. associated with the allocation process shall be made explicit in the advance public notification process, and with the exception of ordinary customs duties and/or other charges as noted in Chinese Taipei’s schedule, shall be commensurate with the cost of the services rendered. Chinese Taipei requires a refundable bid bond of no more than 10 percent from applicants for rice TRQ.  No other performance or bid bond requirements shall be instituted.\n\nAllocation:  Allocations shall be established for commercially viable shipping quantities, but a ceiling of no more than 20 percent of each segment shall be established in advance and published as part of the allocation notification procedures. Allocation certificates shall be valid for product arriving between 1 January and 15 September for the first private sector quota allocation of the calendar year.  Subsequent allocation certificates shall be valid between one day after the date of allocation and 15 September. The date of arrival shall be defined in accordance with Article 6 of the implementing regulations of the Customs Law of Chinese Taipei as of the date of accession. Upon request and proof of signed contract before 15 September, MOF shall automatically extend the validity date of the certificate to cover products arriving on or before 31 December. \n\nReallocation of unused allocations: In any year, if the holder of a quota allocation certificate has not contracted for import of the holder’s total allocation by 15 September, the unused portion of the allocation shall be reallocated through a competitive process. Reallocation certificates shall be valid for 90 days."
